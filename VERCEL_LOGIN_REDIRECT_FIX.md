# Vercel Login Redirect Issue - Complete Fix Guide

## Problem Diagnosis

The issue you're experiencing is a common NextAuth.js redirect problem in Vercel production environments. The authentication is working (JWT callback succeeds), but the redirect to dashboard fails, causing the session to show as "unauthenticated" on the frontend.

## Root Causes

1. **Missing NEXTAUTH_URL environment variable** in Vercel
2. **Session state inconsistency** between server and client
3. **Redirect callback not working properly** in production environment

## Required Fixes

### 1. Set Environment Variables in Vercel

**CRITICAL**: You must set these environment variables in your Vercel dashboard:

1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project: `dhanvantari-ayurveda-dynamic-websit`
3. Go to **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
4. Add these variables for **BOTH Production AND Preview** environments:

| Variable Name | Value | Environment |
|---------------|-------|-------------|
| `NEXTAUTH_URL` | `https://dhanvantari-ayurveda-dynamic-websit.vercel.app` | Production & Preview |
| `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` | `904bcaf3fb4242505d7c8971e34372294503f039e43dab34040b223d9dcdef0d` | Production & Preview |
| `DATABASE_URL` | `your-actual-database-url` | Production & Preview |

**Important Notes:**
- Use your actual Vercel deployment URL for `NEXTAUTH_URL`
- Make sure to include `https://` protocol
- Set for BOTH Production and Preview environments
- After adding variables, **redeploy** your application

### 2. Code Changes Applied

I've already made the following fixes to your codebase:

#### A. Fixed NextAuth Redirect Callback (`app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/options.ts`)
- Improved URL construction using proper URL API
- Better domain validation for security
- More robust fallback logic

#### B. Enhanced Login Page Redirect Logic (`app/(auth)/auth/login/page.tsx`)
- More reliable session detection
- Immediate redirect using `window.location.replace()` for production
- Better error handling and fallbacks

### 3. Deployment Steps

1. **Commit and push** the code changes (already applied)
2. **Set environment variables** in Vercel dashboard (as shown above)
3. **Redeploy** your application:
   - Go to Vercel Dashboard → Deployments
   - Find latest deployment → Click "..." → "Redeploy"

### 4. Testing the Fix

After redeployment, test the complete flow:

1. Visit: `https://dhanvantari-ayurveda-dynamic-websit.vercel.app/auth/login`
2. Enter correct credentials
3. User should be redirected to dashboard successfully
4. Check browser console - should see successful redirect logs

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Login Success**: User enters correct credentials
2. **Authentication**: NextAuth validates and creates session
3. **Redirect**: User is immediately redirected to `/dashboard`
4. **Session Active**: Dashboard loads with user authenticated

## Troubleshooting

### If redirect still fails:

1. **Check Vercel Logs**:
   - Go to Vercel Dashboard → Functions
   - Check for any authentication errors

2. **Verify Environment Variables**:
   - Ensure `NEXTAUTH_URL` matches your exact Vercel domain
   - Confirm all variables are set for Production environment

3. **Clear Browser Cache**:
   - Clear cookies and local storage
   - Try in incognito/private mode

4. **Check Database Connection**:
   - Ensure `DATABASE_URL` is correct
   - Verify database is accessible from Vercel

### If you see "INVALID_CALLBACK_URL" error:

This means `NEXTAUTH_URL` is not set correctly:
- Double-check the URL in Vercel environment variables
- Ensure it includes `https://` protocol
- Match your exact Vercel deployment domain

## Security Notes

- The NextAuth secret provided is for development - consider generating a new one for production
- Ensure your database credentials are secure
- Keep environment variables private and never commit them to code

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] `NEXTAUTH_URL` set in Vercel to `https://dhanvantari-ayurveda-dynamic-websit.vercel.app`
- [ ] `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` set in Vercel
- [ ] `DATABASE_URL` set correctly in Vercel
- [ ] Environment variables set for BOTH Production and Preview
- [ ] Application redeployed after setting variables
- [ ] Login redirect works successfully
- [ ] Dashboard loads properly after login
- [ ] No console errors during authentication

## Support

If you continue to experience issues:

1. Check the specific error messages in browser console
2. Review Vercel function logs for backend errors
3. Verify each environment variable is set correctly
4. Test the authentication flow step by step

The fixes applied should resolve the redirect issue completely once the environment variables are properly configured in Vercel.
