# Vercel NextAuth Error Page Fix - Complete Guide

## Problem Diagnosis

You're getting redirected to `/api/auth/error` on Vercel, which indicates a NextAuth.js configuration issue. According to [NextAuth.js documentation](https://next-auth.js.org/deployment), on Vercel, you **DO NOT** need to set `NEXTAUTH_URL` as NextAuth automatically detects the correct URL.

## Root Causes

1. **Incorrect NEXTAUTH_URL configuration** - On Vercel, this should NOT be set
2. **Environment variable conflicts** between local and production
3. **Missing or incorrect NEXTAUTH_SECRET**

## Required Fixes

### 1. Remove NEXTAUTH_URL from Vercel Environment Variables

**CRITICAL**: You must REMOVE the `NEXTAUTH_URL` environment variable from Vercel:

1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project: `dhanvantari-ayurveda-dynamic-websit`
3. Go to **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
4. **DELETE** the `NEXTAUTH_URL` variable if it exists
5. Keep only these variables:

| Variable Name | Value | Environment |
|---------------|-------|-------------|
| `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` | `904bcaf3fb4242505d7c8971e34372294503f039e43dab34040b223d9dcdef0d` | Production & Preview |
| `DATABASE_URL` | `your-actual-database-url` | Production & Preview |
| Other email/database vars | `your-values` | Production & Preview |

**Important Notes:**
- **DO NOT SET NEXTAUTH_URL** on Vercel - NextAuth detects it automatically
- Only set `NEXTAUTH_URL` for local development
- Set `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` for both Production and Preview environments
- After removing variables, **redeploy** your application

### 2. Code Changes Applied

I've made the following critical fixes to your codebase:

#### A. Fixed NextAuth Configuration (`app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/options.ts`)
- **Removed dependency on NEXTAUTH_URL** - Now uses Vercel's automatic URL detection
- **Enabled debug logging** to identify authentication issues
- **Added event handlers** for better debugging
- **Improved redirect callback** to work properly with Vercel's baseUrl

#### B. Enhanced Error Handling and Debugging
- Added comprehensive event logging for signin, signout, and session events
- Better error handling in redirect callback
- Debug mode enabled to capture authentication flow issues

### 3. Deployment Steps

1. **REMOVE NEXTAUTH_URL** from Vercel environment variables
2. **Commit and push** the code changes (already applied)
3. **Redeploy** your application:
   - Go to Vercel Dashboard → Deployments
   - Find latest deployment → Click "..." → "Redeploy"

### 4. Testing the Fix

After redeployment, test the complete flow:

1. Visit: `https://dhanvantari-ayurveda-dynamic-websit.vercel.app/auth/login`
2. Enter correct credentials
3. Check Vercel function logs for detailed authentication flow
4. User should be redirected to dashboard successfully

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Login Success**: User enters correct credentials
2. **Authentication**: NextAuth validates and creates session
3. **No Error Redirect**: User stays on login or redirects to dashboard (no `/api/auth/error`)
4. **Session Active**: Dashboard loads with user authenticated

## Troubleshooting

### If you still get redirected to `/api/auth/error`:

1. **Check Vercel Function Logs**:
   - Go to Vercel Dashboard → Functions → View Function Logs
   - Look for NextAuth error messages and authentication flow logs

2. **Verify Environment Variables**:
   - Ensure `NEXTAUTH_URL` is **NOT SET** in Vercel
   - Confirm `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` is properly set
   - Verify `DATABASE_URL` is correct

3. **Database Connection Issues**:
   - Check if your database is accessible from Vercel
   - Verify database credentials and connection string
   - Test database connection from Vercel environment

4. **Clear Browser Data**:
   - Clear all cookies and local storage
   - Try in incognito/private mode
   - Test with different browsers

### Common Error Patterns:

1. **"Invalid callback URL"** → NEXTAUTH_URL incorrectly set (should be removed on Vercel)
2. **Database connection errors** → Check DATABASE_URL and database accessibility
3. **"Configuration error"** → Verify NEXTAUTH_SECRET is set correctly

## Security Notes

- The NextAuth secret provided is for development - consider generating a new one for production
- Ensure your database credentials are secure
- Keep environment variables private and never commit them to code

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] `NEXTAUTH_URL` set in Vercel to `https://dhanvantari-ayurveda-dynamic-websit.vercel.app`
- [ ] `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` set in Vercel
- [ ] `DATABASE_URL` set correctly in Vercel
- [ ] Environment variables set for BOTH Production and Preview
- [ ] Application redeployed after setting variables
- [ ] Login redirect works successfully
- [ ] Dashboard loads properly after login
- [ ] No console errors during authentication

## Support

If you continue to experience issues:

1. Check the specific error messages in browser console
2. Review Vercel function logs for backend errors
3. Verify each environment variable is set correctly
4. Test the authentication flow step by step

The fixes applied should resolve the redirect issue completely once the environment variables are properly configured in Vercel.
